Legal document query system.

- Designed and implemented an advanced model capable of providing precise answers to queries derived from the content of legal documents, with a particular emphasis on Indian legal documentation.
- Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques including roBERTa, LLAMA, and employing sophisticated naive approaches, the system ensures robust performance and accuracy in delivering results.

**Data Preparation**

From the website "indiacode.nic.in," we gathered an extensive dataset of legal documents covering a variety of
legal topics, such as health law, education law, and more. In order to get the data ready for use in an answering
model, we extensively extracted text from PDF files and underwent a thorough preprocessing process. By ensuring
the data was clean and appropriate for training and testing our question-answering model, this thorough preprocessing
attempted to enable more precise and efficient legal information retrieval and analysis.
